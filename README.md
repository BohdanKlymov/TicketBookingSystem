# Web Cinema Simulation

This project is a web-based cinema simulation built with Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite. It provides an interactive web interface where users can browse a list of available movies, view details, and book tickets directly online.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of backend logic, database management, and frontend interactivity, using Flask as the core web framework.

## Core Features

Movie List Interface – Displays all available movies with details such as information about films and price.

Ticket Booking System – Allows users to select a movie and book tickets.

Database Integration – Uses SQLite to store movie data, bookings, and availability without requiring external tools like DBeaver.

Dynamic Frontend – Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive, user-friendly web interface.

Flask Backend – Manages routing, handles form submissions, and interacts with the SQLite database.

## Learning Focus

This project demonstrates a practical combination of backend development with Flask and frontend interaction with HTML/CSS/JS. It focuses on:

Managing data through an SQLite database.

Building dynamic web pages with Flask templates.

Structuring a scalable web application across multiple files and folders.

Using JavaScript to enhance user experience with interactive elements.
