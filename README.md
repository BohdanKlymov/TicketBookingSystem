# Cinema simulation

This project is a fully functional console-based cinema simulation built with Python, focusing on mastering the use of dictionaries (dict) and structured programming. The program is organized into two separate files — main.py and methods.py — and uses a function-based architecture, where each user action triggers specific functions.

## Project Structure

Main.py – contains the main program logic, user interface flow, and function calls based on user actions.

Methods.py – contains all core functions responsible for dictionary manipulation, ticket management, and data processing.

## Core Features

Add New Movies – Add new movies with customizable seat availability and ticket prices.

View All Movies – Display the complete list of movies, including those added by the user during runtime.

Book Tickets – Reserve seats for a selected movie and automatically calculate the total cost.

Return Tickets – Cancel existing bookings, update seat availability in real time, and display the total refund amount to the user based on the tickets they return.

Dynamic Data Storage – All movie-related information is stored and modified within a central dictionary structure.
